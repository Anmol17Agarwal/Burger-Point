# Burger-Point

Started a new journey by creating first web development project using HTML and CSS.Every beginnerâ€™s coding journey in frontend starts with these two basic building blocks and you need to be creative when it comes to designing a beautiful application.

## What is HTML

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.HTML describes the structure of a Web page.HTML consists of a series of elements.HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
- The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page
- The `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML page
- The `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
- The `<body>` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
- The `<h1>` element defines a large heading
- The `<p>` element defines a paragraph

## What is CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

- Use the HTML `style` attribute for inline styling
- Use the HTML `<style>` element to define internal CSS
- Use the HTML `<link>` element to refer to an external CSS file
- Use the HTML `<head>` element to store <style> and <link> elements
- Use the CSS `color` property for text colors
- Use the CSS `font-family` property for text fonts
- Use the CSS `font-size` property for text sizes
- Use the CSS `border` property for borders
- Use the CSS `padding` property for space inside the border
- Use the CSS `margin` property for space outside the border
